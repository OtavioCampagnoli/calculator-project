### What I've Done:

- [X] `appendToDisplay(value)`: Add the specified value to the calculator display, checking if there's already a number before or if the value is not an operator.

- [X] `clearDisplay()`: Clear the calculator display, setting its value to null and the `ariaPlaceholder` attribute to "0".

- [X] `backspace()`: Remove the last character from the calculator display.

- [X] `getDisplayValue()`: Get the current value of the calculator display.

- [X] `updateValueScreen(value)`: Update the value of the calculator display with the specified value.

- [X] `alreadyHaveAnOperator(newValue)`: Check if there's already an operator in the calculator display before adding a new operator.

- [X] `isOperator(value)`: Check if the specified value is a valid operator.

- [X] `haveANumberFirst()`: Check if there's a number in the calculator display before adding an operator.

- [X] `calculate()`: Perform the calculation based on the current content of the calculator display, considering the present mathematical expression.

- [X] `isDivisionByZero`: Validation to prevent division by zero.
  
- [X] History of all performed operations.
